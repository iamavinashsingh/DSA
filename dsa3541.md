# 3541 :  Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant 

 Problem → From a given string, find:

The vowel with max frequency

The consonant with max frequency
Return the sum of those two frequencies.

Step 1: Count frequency of every character
We use an array freq[26] to keep track of how many times each letter appears.

Step 2: Track maximums

If character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) → update maxVowel

Else → update maxConsonant

This way, we always know the highest frequency so far.

Step 3: Add them together
Finally → return maxVowel + maxConsonant.
Example: "successes"

Vowels → e(2), u(1) → max = 2

Consonants → s(4), c(2) → max = 4
Answer = 2 + 4 = 6 ✅

Key takeaways:

Simple frequency counting solves many string problems.

Complexity: O(n) since we just scan once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFreqSum(string s) {
        int freq[26], maxVowel = 0, maxConso = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            int i = c - 'a';
            freq[i]++;
            if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                maxVowel = max(maxVowel, freq[i]);
            }
            else {
                maxConso = max(maxConso, freq[i]);
            }
        }
        return maxVowel + maxConso;
    }
};

```
