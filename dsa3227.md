# 3227: Vowels Game in a String 🎮

Alice & Bob take turns deleting substrings:
Alice → substring with odd vowels
Bob → substring with even vowels
Alice wins if Bob can’t play.
Here’s the easiest way to think about it 👇
At first glance, it feels like a tough game theory problem 😅
But let’s simplify:
👉 Alice can only play if the string has at least 1 vowel.
👉 If there are no vowels, Alice loses immediately.
Key observation 💡:
If there is ≥1 vowel, Alice always wins.
Why? Because she can just remove a substring containing a vowel (odd count).
Eventually Bob runs out of moves.
If there are 0 vowels, Alice can’t start → Bob wins.
So the solution is just:
✔️ Count vowels in the string.
✔️ If count > 0 → return true (Alice wins).
✔️ Else → return false.
That’s it. O(n) check. ✅
Final takeaway:
Not all game theory problems need DP or Grundy numbers.
Sometimes the trick is spotting the base condition.
Would you have overcomplicated this at first glance? 👀



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
        return count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c) {
        return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';});
    }
};


```
