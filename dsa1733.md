## Ques 1733 LeetCode :-  minimum number of users you need to teach.
On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer n, an array languages, and an array friendships where:

There are n languages numbered 1 through n,
languages[i] is the set of languages the i​​​​​​th​​​​ user knows, and
friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i] denotes a friendship between the users u​​​​​​​​​​​i​​​​​ and vi.
You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if x is a friend of y and y is a friend of z, this doesn't guarantee that x is a friend of z.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 500
languages.length == m
1 <= m <= 500
1 <= languages[i].length <= n
1 <= languages[i][j] <= n
1 <= u​​​​​​i < v​​​​​​i <= languages.length
1 <= friendships.length <= 500
All tuples (u​​​​​i, v​​​​​​i) are unique
languages[i] contains only unique values


## 1/
Problem: We have users, each speaking some languages. Friendships exist, but two friends can only chat if they share a common language. If not, we must teach them one. Find the minimum users to teach.

## 2/
Naïve idea: Try every friendship, directly teach them a random common language. But that could mean teaching way more users than needed. The trick is to focus only on users who can’t talk at all.

## 3/
Step 1: Identify all “problem friendships” — pairs with no common language. From them, collect the set of users who need help. Everyone else is fine, no need to waste teaching.

## 4/
Step 2: For these users, try teaching them each possible language. For every language, count how many don’t know it already. That’s the number we’d need to teach if we pick that language.

## 5/
Finally, pick the language with the minimum teaching count. That’s the optimal solution: we minimize the number of users who must learn something new. Elegant and efficient.

## 6/
Takeaway: Instead of brute-forcing friendships or teaching randomly, shrink the problem. First target only the “users who struggle,” then evaluate language choices. Clear, optimal, and interviewer-friendly.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTeachings(int totalLanguages, vector<vector<int>>& userLanguages, vector<vector<int>>& friendships) {
        unordered_set<int> usersToTeach;

        // Step 1: Identify users who can't communicate
        for (auto& friendship : friendships) {
            int user1 = friendship[0] - 1; // Convert to 0-based index
            int user2 = friendship[1] - 1;
            bool canCommunicate = false;

            for (int lang1 : userLanguages[user1]) {
                for (int lang2 : userLanguages[user2]) {
                    if (lang1 == lang2) {
                        canCommunicate = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (canCommunicate) break;
            }

            if (!canCommunicate) {
                usersToTeach.insert(user1);
                usersToTeach.insert(user2);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Try teaching each language
        int minUsersToTeach = userLanguages.size() + 1;

        for (int language = 1; language <= totalLanguages; language++) {
            int count = 0;

            for (int user : usersToTeach) {
                bool knowsLanguage = false;
                for (int lang : userLanguages[user]) {
                    if (lang == language) {
                        knowsLanguage = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!knowsLanguage) count++;
            }

            minUsersToTeach = min(minUsersToTeach, count);
        }

        return minUsersToTeach;
    }
};
